# **Mechanistic modeling of viral dynamics & identification of mCoP in NHPs**
Author: Marie Alexandre  
Date: `r Sys.Date()`

## **Objectives of the project**

The code provided in this folder is an original code developed in the modeling work published by [@alexandre2022elife]. \n

This work aimed at :

**(1)** Modeling viral dynamics (genomic and subgenomic) collected in Non-Human Primates after Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 infection using a mechanistic modeling to understand and evaluate the immune mechanisms involved in the vaccine response. 

**(2)** Identifying the vaccine-induced immune mechanisms of action and mechanistic correlate of protection (mCoP), i.e. immune markers capturing these effects.
