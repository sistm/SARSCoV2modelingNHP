## **Objectives of the project**

The code provided in this folder is an original code developed in the
modeling work published by (Alexandre et al. 2022).

This work aimed at :

**(1)** Modeling viral dynamics (genomic and subgenomic) collected in
Non-Human Primates after Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 infection using a mechanistic
modeling to understand and evaluate the immune mechanisms involved in
the vaccine response.

**(2)** Identifying the vaccine-induced immune mechanisms of action and
mechanistic correlate of protection (mCoP), i.e.Â immune markers
capturing these effects.
