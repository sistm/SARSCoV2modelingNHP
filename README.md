# SARSCoV2modelingNHP

This project focuses on the mechanistic model of viral and/or immune response dynamics in non-human primates following SARS-CoV-2 infection in preclinical vaccine studies. 
It includes two subprojects: 

1. **ViralDyn_mCoPIdentification** (project conducted in 2020/2021)  
This project led to a publication [Alexandre et al. 2022, Elife] and aimed first at modeling viral dynamics in order to identify and quantify the main immune mechanisms involved in vaccine- and natural-induced immunity after infection.
Second, a data mining approach was proposed to identify immune markers that could be identified as robust mechanistic correlate of protection. 

2. **EarlyViralandAntibodyDynPostInfection** (project conducted in 2023/2025)  
This project led to a publication (under submission) and aimed at jointly modeling viral and antibody response dynamics in order to quantify the protective concentration of neutralizing antibodies against viral spreading after infection.
